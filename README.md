üè• Hospital Dashboard: Patient Flow & Waitlist Insights
An interactive and data-rich Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize hospital patient flow across inpatient, outpatient, and day case categories. The tool offers a clear overview of waiting list trends, specialty-wise insights, and demographic breakdowns to enhance healthcare decision-making.

2. Short Description / Purpose
The Hospital Dashboard is a comprehensive data visualization solution built in Power BI to analyze over 500,000 patient records aggregated from 8 distinct CSV datasets. It focuses on patient wait times, specialties, and demographic breakdowns across inpatient, outpatient, and day case categories. The dashboard is developed for hospital administrators, healthcare analysts, and strategic planners to optimize resource allocation and improve patient care pathways.

3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
‚Ä¢ üìä Power BI Desktop ‚Äì Primary platform for visual reporting and data interaction.
‚Ä¢ üìÇ Power Query ‚Äì Used to clean, transform, and combine data from 8 CSV datasets into a unified model.
‚Ä¢ üß† DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì Applied for calculated fields, conditional formatting, and dynamic visuals.
‚Ä¢ üìù Data Modeling ‚Äì Relationships established between key datasets (e.g., Inpatient, Outpatient) to enable accurate cross-filtering and aggregation.
‚Ä¢ üìÅ File Format ‚Äì .pbix for development and sharing; export options include PDF and image formats for reporting.

4. Data Source
Source: (Link to be provided)
The dataset comprises over 500,000 rows of hospital patient records extracted from eight separate CSV files, later cleaned, transformed, and merged into a unified model.
This comprehensive dataset captures data points including:
‚Ä¢	Case Type (Inpatient, Outpatient, Day Case)
‚Ä¢	Specialty Name & Group
‚Ä¢	Archive Dates
‚Ä¢	Patient Age Profile
‚Ä¢	Waiting List Details (average and median)
The data spans a time period from 2018 to 2021, allowing for multi-year trend analysis, performance benchmarking, and seasonal pattern detection. It offers a robust foundation for understanding patient waitlist behavior and healthcare service distribution across different care types and specialties.

5. Features / Highlights
‚Ä¢ Business Problem
Hospitals deal with an enormous volume of patient data, making it difficult to track patterns in patient flow, wait times, and specialty performance. Stakeholders often lack a centralized tool that provides clarity on resource utilization and bottlenecks in patient care.
‚Ä¢ Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver an intuitive and actionable visual platform that:
‚Ä¢	Enables users to monitor hospital performance by case type and specialty.
‚Ä¢	Identifies inefficiencies and long wait times across different departments.
‚Ä¢	Helps healthcare professionals make data-driven decisions to enhance operational efficiency and patient satisfaction.

‚Ä¢ Business Impact & Insights
Operational Efficiency:
Hospital administrators can quickly identify specialties or departments with unusually high or low wait times, helping reallocate staff or equipment more effectively.
Resource Planning:
The dashboard enables proactive planning based on patient flow trends across age groups, case types, and time periods‚Äîhelping anticipate peak demand.
Patient Experience Improvement:
By targeting specialties with high median wait times, patient care teams can implement strategies to reduce delays and improve service quality.
Strategic Decision-Making:
Provides clear visibility for policymakers, enabling decisions based on specialties with underperformance, or evaluating demand for specific services like day cases or outpatient clinics.
Marketing Optimization:
Healthcare marketing teams can use these insights to promote less congested services or highlight improvements in patient care and turnaround times.
